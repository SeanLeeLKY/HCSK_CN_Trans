  <Chromium.label>chromium alloy</Chromium.label>
  <Chromium.description>Chromium is a steely-gray, lustrous, hard but brittle metal. It is a remarkably magnetic metal, but needs to be combined with other metals to be of use.</Chromium.description>

  <NickelBar.label>nickel alloy</NickelBar.label>
  <NickelBar.description>Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. Nickel is a silvery-white metal with a slight golden tinge that takes a high polish. Nickel is ferromagnetic (it can become magnetized when paired with a magnetic metal).</NickelBar.description>

  <Cobalt.label>cobalt alloy</Cobalt.label>
  <Cobalt.description>Cobalt-based blue pigments have been used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass. The color was later thought by alchemists to have been caused by the metal known as bismuth. Cobalt is a magnetic metal.</Cobalt.description>

  <AluminiumBar.label>aluminium alloy</AluminiumBar.label>
  <AluminiumBar.description>Aluminium is an alloy of Bauxite Ore. A similar and less valuable metal than Copper, it is mainly used for its high conductivity in electrical applications. Aluminum Alloy processing requires electrical currents to function, so it cannot be done by hand at an unpowered smelter. Aluminum is paramagnetic (it becomes attracted to magnetic metals to strengthen the magnetic bond)..</AluminiumBar.description>

  <LeadBar.label>lead alloy</LeadBar.label>
  <LeadBar.description>Lead is an alloy of Anglesite Ore. It is a heavy metal that is denser than most common materials. Lead is soft and malleable, and has a relatively low melting point.</LeadBar.description>

  <Plasteel.label>steel alloy</Plasteel.label>
  <Plasteel.description>Steel Alloy is a group of iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content less than 2%. A tougher metal than cast-iron that comes with a higher production cost. Steel is ferromagnetic (it can become magnetized when paired with a magnetic metal).</Plasteel.description>

  <FerrosiliconAlloy.label>sendust alloy</FerrosiliconAlloy.label>
  <FerrosiliconAlloy.description>Sendust Alloy is produced by the reduction of Silicon in presence of Iron and Aluminum. Sendust is useful as a deoxidizing agent with other metals. It is more durable than standard Cast-Iron or Steel. Sendust is not a magnetic metal.</FerrosiliconAlloy.description>
  <FerrosiliconAlloy.stuffProps.stuffAdjective>Sendust</FerrosiliconAlloy.stuffProps.stuffAdjective>

  <CupronickelAlloy.label>melchior alloy</CupronickelAlloy.label>
  <CupronickelAlloy.description>Melchior is an alloy of Copper, Nickel and Aluminum. This alloy combination has a higher resistance to corrosion and electricity than standard alloys of Copper or Aluminum. Melchior Alloy is a magnetic metal.</CupronickelAlloy.description>

  <SteelBar.label>stein alloy</SteelBar.label>
  <SteelBar.description>Stein is an alloy of Iron, Nickel. This combination produces a metal alloy that is tougher than Sendust Alloy. Stein Alloy is a magnetic metal.</SteelBar.description>

  <AlnicoAlloy.label>alnico alloy</AlnicoAlloy.label>
  <AlnicoAlloy.description>Alnico is an alloy of Steel, Nickel, Aluminum and Cobalt. It has a high coercively (resistance to loss of magnetism) and is useful to make permanent magnets or magnetic shielding.</AlnicoAlloy.description>

  <DepletedUranium.label>depleted uranium alloy</DepletedUranium.label>
  <DepletedUranium.description>Depleted Uranium Alloy is created by refining Uranium Ore through a Gas Centrifuge. The dangerous radiation has been removed, resulting in a unique high density and strong metal ideal for armor plating or armor-piercing projectiles.</DepletedUranium.description>
  <DepletedUranium.stuffProps.stuffAdjective>Depleted Uranium</DepletedUranium.stuffProps.stuffAdjective>

  <CarbonAlloy.label>carbon fiber alloy</CarbonAlloy.label>
  <CarbonAlloy.description>Carbon Fiber Alloy is an extremely strong and light fiber-reinforced nanomaterial polymer, which contains carbon fibers. It is created at a Chemical Laboratory.</CarbonAlloy.description>
