  <Apparello_Quote.label>战地工程师面甲</Apparello_Quote.label>
  <Apparello_Quote.description>Often referred to as Redcaps, the war-engineers were in charge of keeping the supply lines up and running. The are stories of one heroic forward scout war-engineer crashlanding on a Tunnelworld during a war in the local star system. Said engineer eventually escaped the planet after somehow managing to activate a nuclear device in the planet's core, which left the planet uninhabitable. 
		It is not known whether his tale of the Tunnelworld being under dictatorship of a powerhungry scientist was true or not. The ramblings about speedrunning through hell with his girlfriend on tow was big blow on his credibility. The only truth in whole story is that the Tunnelworld did indeed blow up!
