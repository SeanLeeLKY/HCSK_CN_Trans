//// Graphic stuff
  <graphicData>
    <graphicClass>common ones are Graphic_Multi and Graphic_Single(1x1 only?)</graphicClass>
    <texPath>Things/Building/StorageTest/path to texture, e.g., myFurniture should point to myFurniture.png</texPath>
         For example, myFurniture/myFurniture if you have myFurniture/myFurniture_east.png
    <drawSize>(X,Y) - how big the texture pictures are.  If you have a half-square border around (2,1), it's (3,2)</drawSize>
       If you have a full square border, it's (4,3), etc.
    <shaderType>Optional.  CutoutComplex - if you use it, I have no idea what it does</shaderType>
    // Shadows
    <shadowData>This is one option for shadows.  If you use this, don't use anything else
      <volume>(X,Y,Z) where Y is heigh of shadow above ground.  A short (2,1) object might want (1.8,.1,.8)</volume>
      <offset>(X,0,Z) if you want the shadow offset for whatever reason</offset>
          +Z diretion means to the South
          -X direction is off to the right??
    </shadowData>
    // see below for more shadow options
  </graphicData>
  <castEdgeShadows>true</castEdgeShadows>  makes soft fuzzy shadowy rectangle around object's foot
      (Can't use shadow volume above; ...as of 1.0, you can?  If you want that look.)
  <staticSunShadowHeight>0.5</staticSunShadowHeight>makes sharp rectangular shadow this high
      (Can't use shadow volume above...now can?)

//// Building basics
  <size>(2,1) is default</size>Default is (2,1) - you only need to set something if it's different
  <statBases>
    <MaxHitPoints>50 is not many</MaxHitPoints>
    <WorkToBuild>Chess table has 1000 (wooden gives "117" in game); bed has around 150? Ish?</WorkToBuild>
    <Flammability>1.0 is flammable?  0 is not?</Flammability>
    <Beauty>how beautiful.  Negative numbers are ugly.</Beauty>
    <Mass>10</Mass> in kg
    </statBases>
    <pathCost>150</pathCost> - Hard to walk thru.  Best to leave it.
/// Cost:
  <stuffCategories>What it can be made from
    <li>Leathery</li>
    <li>Fabric</li>
    <li>Metallic</li>
    <li>Woody</li>
    <li>Stony</li>
  </stuffCategories>
  <costStuffCount>45</costStuffCount>How much it costs.
     To do things with fixed costs (in addition to stuff costs or whatever):
  <costList><Cloth>25</Cloth><Steel>20</Steel><etc></etc></costList>
     Note that it's impossible (so far) to have more than one "stuff" choice
/// Research  Prereqs:
  <researchPrerequisites Inherit="false">OPTIONAL  - false to remove or change research Prereqs away from ComplexFurniture
    <li>...<li> - leave empty (with false above) for no prereqs, change with false, or just add new ones
  </researchPrerequisites>
// Storage:  (What can be stored)
  <building>
    <preventDeteriorationOnTop>false</etc>Optional - you can turn off preventing deterioration if you want.  Default is true
    <ignoreStoredThingsBeauty>false</etc>Optional - you can stop ignoring things' beauty if you want.  Default is true.
    <fixedStorageSettings> - what it is CAPABLE of storing

        There's a mod "No Default Shelf Storage" that turns this off for vanilla shelves.

/// Deep Storage!
  <comps>
    <li Class="LWM.DeepStorage.Properties" >
      <maxNumberStacks>2</maxNumberStacks> - how many stacks can be in each cell at once
      <minNumberStacks>1</minNumberStacks> - per cell
      Two ways to say how long storing takes:  (users can always scale storing time in mod options)
      Flat storing time:
      <timeStoringTakes>1000</timeStoringTakes> - how many Ticks storing takes
         1000 is a long while, 300 is a bit, 0 is no time at all (like a vanilla shelf)
      Scaling storing time:
      <minTimeStoringTakes>300</minTimeStoringTakes>
      <additionalTimeEachStack>100</additionalTimeEachStack> - each stack already in that cell
          So if you are putting catfood in a bowl, but it already has 2 dogfood and 1 fishfood,
          this will get added three times.
      <additionalTimeEachDef>200</additionalTimeEachDef> - each different type of thing
          Technically, each item that cannot stack with other items.
          So if you are putting catfood in a bowl, but it already has 2 dogfood and 1 fishfood,
          this will get added twice.  If you were adding fishfood, it would get added once.
      <additionalTimeStackSize>10</additionalTimeStackSize> - if you have 75 in the stack, takes an extra 750 ticks.
      Mass restrictions:
      <maxTotalMass></maxTotalMass> - per cell
      <maxMassOfStoredItem></maxMassOfStoredItem> - per item.  Items bigger than this just cannot fit
      <altStat></altStat> - to use something besides vanilla mass.  E.g., CombatExtended's Bulk.
      Display:
      <showContents>true</showContents> - default
      Pick an overlay:
      <overlayType>Normal</overlayType> - topmost item shows its usual overlay
      <overlayType>CountOfAllStacks</overlayType> - centered on the DSU - for non-stackable items?
      <overlayType>CountOfStacksPerCell</overlayType> - standard overlay position for each cell
      <overlayType>SumOfAllItems</overlayType> - centered on DSU, for stackable items
      <overlayType>SumOfItemsPerCell</overlayType> - etc.
      <overlayType>None</overlayType> - if you want this for some reason?
    </li>
    <li><compClass>CompQuality</compClass></li> - if you want the item to have quality, which affects beauty
