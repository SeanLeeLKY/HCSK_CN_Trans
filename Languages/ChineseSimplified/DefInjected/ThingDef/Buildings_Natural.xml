  <MineableSteel.label>Iron Ore Deposits</MineableSteel.label>
  <MineableSteel.description>Deposits of Iron Ore. Iron Ore has a variety of uses as an economic metal, being abundant and easy to process. It can be strengthened by being mixed with other metals into alloys.</MineableSteel.description>

  <MineableSilver.label>Silver Ore Deposits</MineableSilver.label>
  <MineableSilver.description>Deposits of Silver Ore. Silver Ore is useful as the primary currency for trading.</MineableSilver.description>

  <MineableGold.label>Gold Ore Deposits</MineableGold.label>
  <MineableGold.description>Deposits of Gold Ore. Gold Ore is a very valuable and precious metal. The allure of this rare beautiful metal is known to bring out terrible greed in people.</MineableGold.description>

  <MineableNitre.label>Nitre Deposits</MineableNitre.label>
  <MineableNitre.description>Deposits of Nitre. Major uses of potassium nitrate are in fertilizers, tree stump removal, rocket propellants and fireworks. It is one of the major components of gunpowder.</MineableNitre.description>

  <MineableLead.label>Anglesite Deposits</MineableLead.label>
  <MineableLead.description>Deposits of Anglesite. Anglesite is the ore form of Lead. It is a heavy metal that is denser than most common materials. Lead is soft and malleable, and has a relatively low melting point.</MineableLead.description>

  <MineableCoal.label>Coal Ore Deposits</MineableCoal.label>
  <MineableCoal.description>Deposits of Coal Ore. Coal is useful as a reaction agent in metal alloy production.</MineableCoal.description>

  <MineablePlasteel.label>Nickel Ore Deposits</MineablePlasteel.label>
  <MineablePlasteel.description>Lateritic nickel ore deposits are surficial, weathered rinds formed on ultramafic rocks. Nickel Ore contains Nickel and small amounts of Cobalt.</MineablePlasteel.description>

  <MineableTin.label>Tin Ore Deposits</MineableTin.label>
  <MineableTin.description>Tin Ore is the second-easiest ore to mine. It is mined from Tin Veins.</MineableTin.description>

  <MineableCopper.label>Copper Ore Deposits</MineableCopper.label>
  <MineableCopper.description>Copper occurs naturally as native copper and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record. Copper is useful for conduction of electrical currents, and is often used as wiring.</MineableCopper.description>

  <MineableAluminium.label>Bauxite Ore Deposits</MineableAluminium.label>
  <MineableAluminium.description>Bauxite is the ore of Aluminium. Aluminum is similar to copper as it is also highly conductive to electrical currents. It is less valuable than copper. Unlike copper however, aluminum can only be processed at an Electric Smelting Furnace. The refining process requires electrical currents in order to make Aluminum Alloy.</MineableAluminium.description>

  <MineableJade.label>Jade</MineableJade.label>
  <MineableJade.description>Rock containing bits of jade.</MineableJade.description>

  <MineableTitanium.label>Ilmenite Ore Deposits</MineableTitanium.label>
  <MineableTitanium.description>Ilmenite is the ore of Titanium. Titanium is a very durable metal and is often used in alloys to produce metals much stronger than steel.</MineableTitanium.description>

  <MineableTungsten.label>Wolframite Ore Deposits</MineableTungsten.label>
  <MineableTungsten.description>Wolframite is the ore of Tungsten. Tungsten is a strong and quite dense material with a high melting temperature used for electric filaments and armor-piercing ammunition, as well as hard tungsten carbide machine tools.</MineableTungsten.description>

  <SteamGeyser.label>steam geyser</SteamGeyser.label>
