  <Rubber.label>Rubber</Rubber.label>
  <Rubber.description>Rubber is useful for a variety of things such as duct pipes, pumps or as a building material supplement/additive.</Rubber.description>

  <SyntheticFibers.label>Synthetic Fibers</SyntheticFibers.label>
  <SyntheticFibers.description>Synthetic Fibers are artifical strands created from Polymers and Sulfur. They can be woven into Synthread Cloth at a Tailor's Workbench, or woven with Carbon into Carbon Fiber Alloy at a Chemical Laboratory.</SyntheticFibers.description>

  <Carbon.label>Carbon</Carbon.label>
  <Carbon.description>Carbon is a fiber-reinforced polymer that is an extremely strong and light. It can be reinforced further with Synthetic Fibers to create Carbon Fiber Alloy at a Chemical Laboratory.</Carbon.description>

  <SyntheticAmmonia.label>Synthetic Ammonia</SyntheticAmmonia.label>
  <SyntheticAmmonia.description>Synthetic ammonia is a product of refined crude oil. It is useful for creating impaction charges.</SyntheticAmmonia.description>

  <Paraffins.label>Paraffin</Paraffins.label>
  <Paraffins.description>Paraffins are a product of refined Crude Oil. It is useful in crafting medicines.</Paraffins.description>

  <Sulfur.label>Sulfur</Sulfur.label>
  <Sulfur.description>Sulfur occurs naturally as the pure element - native sulfur and as sulfide and sulfate minerals. Sulfur can be obtained from refined Crude Oil at a Petrochemical Plant or from processing Iron Ore at an Ammo Crafting Table. It is useful for Gunpowder in crafting various types of turret ammo.</Sulfur.description>
