  <FreeholderKingdom.description>The Royal title of freeholder gives an Royal citizen the right to own productive private property.\n\nIn the Kingdom, most freeholders own no more than a tiny shop or taxi, but some can become very wealthy as merchants, entrepreneurs, or investors.</FreeholderKingdom.description>

  <YeomanKingdom.label>yeoman</YeomanKingdom.label>
  <YeomanKingdom.description>The Royal title of yeoman is held by those who serve a noble lord in an important, specific way. While it is not a noble title and offers no economic rights beyond those of a freeholder, it does give the holder the right to use low-level psychic abilities.\n\nIn the Kingdom, this title is often held by high-level soldiers, warskiff pilots, spies, advisors, diplomats, intrusion operatives, and other key individuals.</YeomanKingdom.description>

  <EsquireKingdom.label>esquire</EsquireKingdom.label>
  <EsquireKingdom.description>The Royal title of esquire is held by individuals at the lowest level of nobility. Esquires are subordinate nobles who mostly do what their liege lord tells them.\n\nIn the Kingdom, esquires might own a city building or a farm complex. During wartime, an esquire might lead a platoon of troops, captain a frigate, or serve their lord as a specialist or advisor.\n\nTheir low rank makes them paradoxically less useful as diplomats than yeomen. Sending a low-ranked esquire to a negotiation can itself be seen as an insult, whereas a yeoman negotiator is seen as only representing his lord.</EsquireKingdom.description>

  <KnightKingdom.description>The Royal title of knight is held by subordinate nobles of significant stature, but without a leadership role. Knights serve higher lords in all their actions, but they are ranked high enough to command respect from everyone.\n\nIn the Kingdom, a knight will control a factory complex, commercial district, or small farming region. In combat, a knight typically leads a company of troops or a small fleet assault group. Knights are expected to engage personally in work and battle.</KnightKingdom.description>

  <PraetorKingdom.label>praetor</PraetorKingdom.label>
  <PraetorKingdom.description>The Royal title of praetor is a bridge between the service-oriented lower titles below and the power-holding nobility above.\n\nIn the Kingdom, praetors usually hold title to a city district, asteroid sector, or agricultural region. At war, they take authority over the smallest combat units that fight independently. On the ground, a praetor will lead a troop cohort. In the fleet, a praetor will captain a destroyer or a combat group.</PraetorKingdom.description>

  <BaronKingdom.label>baron</BaronKingdom.label>
  <BaronKingdom.labelFemale>baroness</BaronKingdom.labelFemale>
  <BaronKingdom.description>The Royal title of baron is the lowest of the middle nobility. While lower titles focus on personal service at war or commerce under a lord, barons hold title as semi-independent rulers. Each baron is subordinate to his liege lord, but his obligations are mostly in supplying wealth and troops, and not in personal service.\n\nIn the Kingdom, a baron will typically own a city sector, mining colony, or similar outfit. At wartime, a baron may captain a capital ship in name, or control a regiment of troops.</BaronKingdom.description>

  <CountKingdom.label>count</CountKingdom.label>
  <CountKingdom.labelFemale>countess</CountKingdom.labelFemale>
  <CountKingdom.description>The Royal title of count is the middle rank of middle nobility.\n\nIn the Kingdom, a count would hold title to a city or colony, and might have a small personal fleet possibly including capital ships.</CountKingdom.description>

  <DukeKingdom.label>duke</DukeKingdom.label>
  <DukeKingdom.labelFemale>duchess</DukeKingdom.labelFemale>
  <DukeKingdom.description>The Royal title of duke is the highest of the middle nobility.\n\nIn the Kingdom, dukes control provinces, mega-cities, or moons. At war, a duke can field a division-level force, or a fleet with capital ships and dozens of support craft.</DukeKingdom.description>

  <ConsulKingdom.label>consul</ConsulKingdom.label>
  <ConsulKingdom.description>The Royal title of consul is a lower level of high nobility.\n\nIn the Kingdom, consuls control planets. At war, a consul can usually field an army-sized force of multiple divisions, supported by several fleets. Some command from a super-capital ship or control space-based megastructures.</ConsulKingdom.description>

  <StellarchKingdom.label>stellarch</StellarchKingdom.label>
  <StellarchKingdom.description>The Royal title of stellarch represents dominion over an entire star system.\n\nIn the Kingdom, since interstellar travel times are years long, stellarchs rule their systems with a great degree of independence. They each swear fealty to the King, but since the King may be many light-years away, a stellarch may go years or decades without interacting with him.</StellarchKingdom.description>


  <!-- King should never appear in the game in any way, it's just here for completeness on UI lists etc. -->

  <KingKingdom.label>King</KingKingdom.label>
  <KingKingdom.labelFemale>queen</KingKingdom.labelFemale>
  <KingKingdom.description>The Royal title of King indicates sovereign dominion over the entire Kingdom, all its peoples, planets, and fleets. All other lords swear fealty to a high lord, while the King swears fealty to no one. However, even the King depends on the support of lower nobles to remain in power.</KingKingdom.description>
