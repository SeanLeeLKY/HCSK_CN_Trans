  <Mechanoid_Centipede.description>Centipedes are heavy combat Mechanoids that crawl on dozens of tiny legs. They resemble a massive, fat grub in appearance. Their heavy armor and firepower makes them very effective against bunched-up static defenders. They are somewhat vulnerable to mobile hit-and-run tactics.</Mechanoid_Centipede.description>

  <!-- Crawler -->

  <Mechanoid_Crawler.label>Crawler</Mechanoid_Crawler.label>
  <Mechanoid_Crawler.description>Crawlers are small spider-like Mechanoids. While not particularly sturdy, their speed, size and numbers more than make up for it. A tiny plasma cutter at their front allows them to cut through metal like butter. Their favorite passtime is open surgery.</Mechanoid_Crawler.description>
