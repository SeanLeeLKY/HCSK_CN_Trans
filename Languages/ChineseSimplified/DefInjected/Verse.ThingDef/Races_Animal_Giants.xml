  <Megabadger.label>大獾</Megabadger.label>
  <Megabadger.description>A truly massive badger - roughly the size of an elephant in adulthood. Megabadgers are incredibly dangerous creatures, with jaws able to bite a fully grown tree to splinters and skin thick enough to stop most bullets. They are not without the characteristic vicious attitude known of smaller badger species. \n\nHaving been known to wipe out entire colonies in the rimworlds, it is advisable under almost all circumstances to completely avoid interaction with megabadgers.</Megabadger.description>
