  <Horse.label>马</Horse.label>
  <Horse.description>A large, peaceful herbivore widely known for its great speed and strength. Horses and humans have a history stretching back for millenia, so it is no surprise to see one. Unfortunately, all your colonists are absolutely inept at riding, otherwise it could make a fitting steed.</Horse.description>


  <!-- Woolly Horse -->

  <WoolyHorse.label>长鬃马</WoolyHorse.label>
  <WoolyHorse.description>A plump horse covered in a thick fur fit for much colder climates. Oddly enough, woolly horses have a throwback to their slower ancestors- actual toed feet; though much larger and further splayed, so as to act as a snowshoe. Odder yet, they seem to be omnivorous, with a set of large canines to boot.</WoolyHorse.description>
