  <Megascarab.description>A large, genetically-engineered beetle. What was once the worker caste of an artifical ecosystem of insectoids designed to fight Mechanoid invasions, it is now usually seen without its deadlier insectoid cousins. Still, its size and hard shell make it dangerous when it attacks. An eusocial creature, it cannot reproduce individually.</Megascarab.description>
