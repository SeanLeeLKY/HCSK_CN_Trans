  <Fishercat.label>鱼猫</Fishercat.label>
  <Fishercat.description>A small mammal of the Marten genus, the Fisher- or alternatively 'Fisher Cat' is neither a fish eater nor a cat. Genetically closer to a weasel, fishers are long bodied but short lived. Considering their small size, fishers are known to be particularly vicious; hunting unusual prey such as porcupines and even young deer.\n\nDespite their cute appearance, fishers are very much wild and not likely to make a good pet.</Fishercat.description>
