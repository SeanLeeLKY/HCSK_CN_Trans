  <Lacosdile.label>lacosdile</Lacosdile.label>
  <Lacosdile.description>A lacosdile is a crossbred and genetically manipulated lizard originally created as part of clever fragrance marketing gig. Being herbivorous and barely dangerous made them very common pets. However as the trends passed lacosdiles were soon found flooding the sewage systems, and in desperation were carried off across the galaxy to the furthest reaches of space. As a result the species now flourish on desolate rimworlds, where they have adapted to become omnivorous.</Lacosdile.description>
