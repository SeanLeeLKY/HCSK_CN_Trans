  <MoonFall.description>This is a tribal scenario. It's essentially the same as the default "Lost Tribe" scenario, except that your pawns are fleeing the devastation of their homeland caused by debris from the cataclysmic destruction of their planet's moon. The worst has passed, but you'll still have to contend with a lot of meteorites, and probably some flash storms, especially in the early weeks of the game. \n\nYou will play for human race。</MoonFall.description>

  <MoonFall.scenario.parts.0.text>The gods destroyed the moon, and hurled its pieces down upon your homeland. Many fled the devastation, but after a long, harrowing journey, only five remain. Rocks still fall from the sky, but their fury has subsided. Perhaps, soon, the gods will once again be at rest. Perhaps, now, you can attempt to build a new home。</MoonFall.scenario.parts.0.text>
