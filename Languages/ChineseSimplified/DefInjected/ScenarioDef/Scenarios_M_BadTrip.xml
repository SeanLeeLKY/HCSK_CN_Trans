  <!-- EN: You, as truly law-abiding citizens of the intergalactic Hegemony, were resting peacefully and lawfully in a medical module on a station near the Ringworld Epsilon, when a sudden attack by mechanoids interrupted your law-abiding vacation, and you and your companions had to urgently separate your module from the main station. Since there was virtually no food in your module, you made the volitional decision to disconnect and dump your bodies from the cryo-capsules and put yourselves in them, trusting that the space wind would carry you to a planet with a peaceful civilization. -->
  <BadTrip.description>作为称霸整个星系国家的守法公民，你们正在环形世界υ（Epsilon）分段附近一个空间站的医疗舱中休息度假。机械族的突然袭击毁掉了你们怡然自得的假期，你和同伴们不得不使用紧急协议分离你们所在的舱段和空间站主体，逃离机械族的威胁。由于医疗舱内几乎没有食物，你们做出了重大决定，将自己的意识信号接驳回身体，并将自己放入冷冻仓进行休眠，祈祷“空间风”会把你们带到一个拥有和平文明的星球。</BadTrip.description>

  <!-- EN: We had two bags of flakes, seventy-five pellets of psychoid leaves, five sheets of wake-up, a saltshaker half-full of yayo, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored methadones, penoxycylines, ibuprofens, ambrosias... Also, a few cases of tequila, rum, a case of beer, a pint of vodka, and one doze of luciferium. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.  -->
  <BadTrip.scenario.parts.GameStartDialog.text>我们有两袋薄片，75精神叶，五片清醒丸，半瓶呀呦粉，还有一整条五颜六色的美沙酮，佩诺西林，布洛芬，仙馐果…… 还有，几箱龙舌兰酒，朗姆酒，一箱啤酒，一品脱伏特加，还有一剂魔鬼素。并不是说我们需要这些全部东西， 但一旦你严重需要这些的话，剩下的这些东西应该能让你占据一些优势。</BadTrip.scenario.parts.GameStartDialog.text>
