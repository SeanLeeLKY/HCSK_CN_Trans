  <Pirate.label>renegade band</Pirate.label>
  <Pirate.description>A loose confederation of renegade gangs who've agreed to mostly fight outsiders instead of fighting each other.\n\nRenegades don't sow, they don't build, and they rarely trade. Driven by a blood-and-honor culture that values personal strength and ruthlessness, they enrich themselves by raiding and robbing their more productive neighbors.\n\nTheir technology level depends mostly on who they've managed to steal from recently. Mostly they carry gunpowder weapons, though some prefer to stab victims at close range.</Pirate.description>
