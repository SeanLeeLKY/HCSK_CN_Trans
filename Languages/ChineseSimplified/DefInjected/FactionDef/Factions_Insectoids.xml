  <Insectoid.description>A hive of gene-modified insects were originally created to fight against the Mechanoid invasion. To accomplish this feat they were programmed to faithfully follow their queen in a hive-like minded system. Unfortunately, the moment they tasted human flesh the insects became more interested in humans than the mechanoids and now pose a great danger to humanity.</Insectoid.description>
