  <NorbalTribe.description>These people have been here a very long time. Maybe their ancestors crashed here a thousand years ago. Maybe they survived some cataclysm that destroyed a technological civilization here. The Norbals are mostly nomadic people who live off of the land using primitive tools and weapons. Some clans are more aggressive than others; many are open to trade and alliances, even with strange people like yourselves. Close cooperation or recruitment will be very difficult because of the vast sociotechnological and linguistic gap between the Norbals and yourselves. Despite their apparent technological weakness, the Norbals can be dangerous enemies and valuable friends because of their skill with low-tech warfare, their numbers, and their hardiness.</NorbalTribe.description>
